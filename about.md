Til now, life has been pretty much ups and downs, but mostly I am floating around in all those years til now. There is now a desire to something that meaningful in life. That is why I decided to blog. Blogging as a way for me to recorded my experience, my learning in university and reflected on these moments, lest I forget any meaningful moments in live.

So here is my commitment on become a better version of who I was yesterday, and the path that I want to walk.
**Life of Me**
I was born in Quy Nhơn, a coastal city.
